# boot

To run this bot on your own:
1. Install package requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

2. If you're using repl.it to host this bot you can create a secret in there named "bottoken" and assign it your token. If you're running this on a standard console, just remove the env stuff and put your token in. 

3. You'll probably need something to host this bot to keep it running. A server is set up inside `stayinAlive.py` if you plan to use repl.it and uptimerobot to keep it up, but just leaving the porgram running in the console on a spare rasp pi or something should work as well. `python bot.py` to kick things off regardless. 

4. Pray that everything went according to plan and your computer doesn't blow up.
