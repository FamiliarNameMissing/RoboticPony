My personal discord bot.

To run this bot on your own:
1. Install package requirements: 'pip install -r requirements.txt'.

2. Create a file named 'secret.py'. Create a variable named "token" and assign it your bot token.

3. Once the packages have installed and secret.py is set up, run `python bot.py`
